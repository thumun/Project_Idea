 <p> <b> User problem: </br> The problem is thst it is often difficult to find the perfect color palette when designing/painting. This problem often leads to a lack of inspiration/"artblock" (at least for me). I usually try to get inspiration from photos/images from the Internet but I am often worried about any legal/moral consequences of using someone else's images.
<br> This application will create color palettes from images that the user uploads. The site would also apply some filters over the colors/allow the user to edit the colors so there would not be any copyright issues. 
<br> It would also be interesting to make the colors aesthetically pleasing in some fashion. For example, using the RGB values in order to avoid contrasting issues.  
<br> There may also be an option to find “similar images” in case the colors available in the user’s image are not to their liking.

<p> <b> Users: </b> This would be most useful for artists or designers (or maybe just someone who wants a certain aesthetic).

<p> <b> Comparison: </b> There are similar apps out there. For example, one app allows the user to pick colors manually from an image while another picks a few random colors. In my app, the site would pick the colors based on conditions (like making sure the colors are not too close to one another RGB-wise). This as well as making the colors work well together will make the selection less random than other sites. I think it would be interesting to allow users to select colors manually but I think the main function of the app is for colors to be picked by the computer.
