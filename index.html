            <h1>Info: </h1>
            <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;"> <b>User problem:</b> The problem is that it is often difficult to find the perfect color palette when designing/painting. This problem often leads to a lack of inspiration/"artblock" (at least for me). I usually try to get inspiration from photos/images from the Internet but I am often worried about any legal/moral consequences of using someone else's images.
                This application will create color palettes from images that the user uploads. The site would also apply some filters over the colors/allow the user to edit the colors so there would not be any copyright issues.
                It would also be interesting to make the colors aesthetically pleasing in some fashion. For example, using the RGB values in order to avoid contrasting issues.
                There may also be an option to find “similar images” in case the colors available in the user’s image are not to their liking.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
                <b>Users:</b> This would be most useful for artists or designers (or maybe just someone who wants a certain aesthetic).
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
                <b>Comparison:</b> There are similar apps out there. For example, one app allows the user to pick colors manually from an image while another picks a few random colors. In my app, the site would pick the colors based on conditions (like making sure the colors are not too close to one another RGB-wise). This as well as making the colors work well together will make the selection less random than other sites. I think it would be interesting to allow users to select colors manually but I think the main function of the app is for colors to be picked by the computer.
